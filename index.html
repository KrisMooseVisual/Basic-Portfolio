    <p>Good day, my name is Mustafa and I'm from Philadelphia, PA. I am a lover of the Hip Hop culture as I grew up in it. I love the history of the culture with a few elements of the culture, such as Breakdancing or bboying/bgirling, Deejaying, and Rap music starting in the South Bronx, NY. Little do most people know is that the 4th element of Hip Hop, graffiti, was started here in Philly!</p>

    <p>I spent many years competing in breakdancing across the country, and I also dabbled in graffiti since I was 13. Though I am now 38, I still dance from time to time, of course, there are things I cannot do anymore! However, the dance is still important and when ever I get the chance to get down with other bboys and bgirls, I'm al in!</p>
